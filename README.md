**Project Description:**
The project is a text-based implementation of the classic game "Rock Paper Scissors." It simulates a game where a player competes against the computer by choosing one of the three options: rock, paper, or scissors. The computer's choice is determined based on the chosen difficulty level. The game continues until either the player or the computer reaches a score of 4, declaring the winner.

**What i've done:**
I've built the core functionality of the game using Java and OOP concepts. I've created different classes for players, implemented difficulty levels for the computer's choices, handled the game logic, and added scoring and health features.

**Next Steps - Adding a Front-End Interface:**
To enhance the project and make it more user-friendly, I have plans of creating a graphical user interface (GUI) for the game. This would allow players to interact visually rather than through the command line.
