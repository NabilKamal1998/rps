**Project Description:**

The project is a text-based implementation of the classic game "Rock Paper Scissors." It simulates a game where a player competes against the computer by choosing one of the three options: rock, paper, or scissors. The computer's choice is determined based on the chosen difficulty level. The game continues until either the player or the computer reaches a score of 4, declaring the winner.

**What i've done:**

I've built the core functionality of the game using Java and OOP concepts. I've created different classes for players, implemented difficulty levels for the computer's choices, handled the game logic, and added scoring and health features.

**Next Steps - Adding a Front-End Interface:**

To enhance the project and make it more user-friendly, I have plans of creating a graphical user interface (GUI) for the game. This would allow players to interact visually rather than through the command line. 

**Reflections:**

Working on a project that leverages my gaming expertise was an absolute blast. The level of enjoyment and intrigue remained constant, irrespective of the project's complexity. Incorporating familiar concepts like health depletion and player classes streamlined the coding process, aided further by ChatGPT, which brought clarity to the logic and reduced the code's disorderliness. 

Nonetheless, there's a potential for things to spiral out of control swiftly, underscoring the significance of comprehending my code; otherwise, I'd find myself starting anew. Persevering through challenges fills me with contentment, having produced something of decent quality. Excitedly looking forward to embarking on the next project!
